# Tips:
#
# 1. Limit the line length to 72 characters
# 2. Use proper sentences 
# 3. Start with a capital letter


print("This is not a comment!")   # This is an inline comment



"""This is a docuementation string

Tips:

1. When these appear on the first line of a funciton, class, method

2. Try to comment all non-trivial blocks of code 
3. Put the last three quotation marks on their own line
